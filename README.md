## Project Status Update

### Completed Phase: Data Exploration
We have completed comprehensive data exploration, analyzing temporal patterns, customer behavior, and product distribution. Key findings and processed datasets are stored in the data/processed directory.

### Key Findings
The analysis revealed significant patterns in sales behavior:
- Strong day-of-week effects with notable Sunday peaks
- Geographic concentration in specific markets
- Clear product category value segments
- Distinct temporal patterns requiring specific handling

### Data Processing Status
- Raw data stored in: data/raw/
- Processed analysis results in: data/processed/
- Complete analysis documentation in: notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb

### Next Steps
Moving to data preprocessing phase which will focus on:
- Feature engineering based on temporal patterns
- Customer segmentation implementation
- Product category encoding
- Geographic market handling

# Retail Sales Forecasting Project Documentation

## Executive Summary
This project implements time series forecasting models to predict retail sales patterns and provide actionable insights for business planning. We developed and evaluated two distinct approaches: Facebook Prophet for capturing long-term trends and seasonality, and XGBoost for leveraging feature-based predictions.

## Project Structure
The project follows a systematic organization:
```
retail_forecasting/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/                 # Original retail sales data
│   └── processed/           # Preprocessed and feature-engineered data
├── notebooks/
│   ├── 01_data_exploration.ipynb
│   ├── 02_preprocessing.ipynb
│   └── 03_modeling.ipynb
└── src/
    ├── preprocessing.py
    ├── modeling.py
    └── utils.py
```

## Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing phase transformed raw retail sales data into analysis-ready formats. Key preprocessing steps included:
- Date/time formatting and feature extraction
- Sales aggregation at appropriate time intervals
- Handling of missing values and outliers
- Creation of temporal features for modeling

## Modeling Approach

### Prophet Implementation
The Prophet model was implemented to capture underlying patterns in the sales data. The model specifically addresses:

1. Trend Analysis
- Long-term sales trajectories
- Overall business growth patterns
- Trend changepoints identification

2. Seasonality Components
- Yearly seasonality patterns for annual cycles
- Weekly patterns showing day-of-week effects
- Daily patterns capturing intraday variations

3. Model Configuration
```python
Prophet(
    yearly_seasonality=True,
    weekly_seasonality=True,
    daily_seasonality=True,
    seasonality_mode='multiplicative'
)
```

### XGBoost Implementation
The XGBoost model incorporated extensive feature engineering to capture complex sales patterns:

1. Feature Engineering
- Lag features (1, 7, 14, 30 days)
- Rolling mean calculations
- Cyclical encoding of temporal features

2. Model Parameters
```python
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=1000,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    max_depth=7,
    min_child_weight=3,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    random_state=42
)
```

## Evaluation Framework
Both models were evaluated using standard regression metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²) Score

The evaluation period covered the final 60 days of available data to assess real-world performance.

## Model Comparison
[Awaiting your actual results to complete this section with specific performance metrics and comparative analysis]

## Development Process
The project followed a structured development approach:

1. Initial Data Exploration
- Understanding data structure and quality
- Identifying temporal patterns
- Analyzing business cycles

2. Model Development
- Systematic implementation of both models
- Careful parameter tuning
- Comprehensive validation procedures

3. Results Visualization
- Time series plots showing actual vs. predicted values
- Component analysis for Prophet
- Feature importance analysis for XGBoost

Would you like me to:
1. Add specific performance metrics once you provide them?
2. Elaborate on any particular section?
3. Include additional technical details about implementation?
4. Add recommendations based on the model results?
